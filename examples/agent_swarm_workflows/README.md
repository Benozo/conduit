# LLM-Powered Advanced Agent Swarm Workflow Patterns

This example demonstrates **LLM-powered** advanced workflow patterns using agent swarms for complex business processes with **Ollama integration**.

## Overview

The advanced workflow swarm consists of five specialized agents:

- **Orchestrator**: Manages complex multi-step workflows using LLM reasoning
- **DataProcessor**: Handles ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations
- **Analyst**: Performs advanced analytics and trend identification
- **Reporter**: Creates comprehensive reports and stakeholder communications
- **QualityController**: Ensures workflow quality and handles exceptions

## Key Features

- ðŸ§  **LLM Workflow Orchestration**: Complex workflow management powered by Ollama LLM
- ðŸ”„ **Multi-Step Process Coordination**: End-to-end business process automation
- ðŸŽ¯ **Context-Aware Routing**: Intelligent agent selection based on workflow state
- âœ… **Quality Control**: LLM-powered quality assurance and exception handling
- ðŸ“Š **Enterprise Patterns**: Real-world business intelligence and data workflows
- ðŸ’­ **Transparent Orchestration**: All workflow decisions include LLM reasoning

## Prerequisites

- **Ollama** running at `192.168.10.10:11434` with a compatible model (e.g., `llama3.2`)
- Go 1.21+ for building and running the example

## Configuration

The example uses the following Ollama configuration:
- **Host**: `192.168.10.10:11434` (configurable via `OLLAMA_URL` env var)
- **Model**: `llama3.2` (configurable via `OLLAMA_MODEL` env var)

## Running the Example

```bash
# Navigate to the example directory
cd examples/agent_swarm_workflows

# Run the example
go run main.go
```
Extract â†’ Transform â†’ Analyze â†’ Report
  â†“data     â†“data      â†“data     â†“final
```

### 6. **Conditional Workflow** ðŸ”€
**Pattern**: Dynamic execution based on runtime conditions and context
## Workflow Scenarios

The example demonstrates four advanced workflow patterns:

1. **ETL Pipeline Workflow**: Complete data extraction, transformation, and loading process
2. **Analytics and Reporting Workflow**: Sales analysis with executive reporting
3. **Quality-Controlled Workflow**: Data processing with quality checks and exception handling
4. **End-to-End Business Intelligence**: Complete BI workflow from data to board presentation

## Advanced Capabilities

### Workflow Orchestration
- LLM-powered workflow design and execution planning
- Dynamic agent coordination based on workflow requirements
- Context-aware process routing and sequencing

### Data Pipeline Management
- Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) operations
- Data quality validation and assurance
- Multi-stage processing with checkpoints

### Analytics and Intelligence
- Trend analysis and pattern recognition
- Strategic insight generation
- Performance metrics and KPI analysis

### Quality Assurance
- Automated quality checks at each workflow stage
- Exception detection and handling
- Emergency response procedures

## Expected Output

The demo will show:
- Complex workflow orchestration with LLM reasoning
- Multi-agent coordination across processing stages
- Quality control and exception handling
- Comprehensive reporting and stakeholder communication
- Execution metrics and workflow performance

## Error Handling

**Important**: This example uses pure LLM reasoning with **no rule-based fallback**. If Ollama is unavailable or the LLM fails, the workflow will error out as intended.

## Enterprise Applications

This pattern is suitable for:
- **Data Pipeline Automation**: Automated ETL processes with quality control
- **Business Intelligence**: End-to-end BI workflows from data to insights
- **Report Generation**: Automated report creation and distribution
- **Process Orchestration**: Complex multi-step business processes
- **Quality Management**: Automated quality assurance workflows

## Customization

You can extend this example by:
- Adding domain-specific workflow agents
- Implementing custom ETL tools for your data sources
- Creating specialized reporting formats
- Adding more sophisticated quality control rules
- Integrating with external systems and APIs

- Multi-agent coordination with context awareness
- Dynamic process routing based on workflow state
- Quality-driven decision making
- Exception handling with LLM reasoning
- No rule-based logic - pure LLM workflow management

Perfect for understanding enterprise-scale LLM-powered workflow automation!
